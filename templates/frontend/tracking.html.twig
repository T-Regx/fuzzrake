        <h1>Automatic tracking and status updates</h1>

        <p>
            Imagine you need to put information about your commissions status (open/closed) in one place only.
            getfursu.it is able to automatically track and reflect your commissions status. How does it work? It's
            easy.
        </p>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="row py-4">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <h2>1. Fill inclusion/update form</h2>
                    <p>
                        You (the fursuit maker) fill in the <a href="{{ data_form_url }}">on-line form</a>. In the form
                        you specify on which website/social media account do you keep your commissions status. You need
                        to fill this form only once, and after that you can forget about all of this.
                    </p>

                <div class="col-sm-6 text-center img">

                    <h2>2. Filled form gets processed</h2>
                    <p>
                        I receive all form submissions and put all the information into the getfursu.it database. This
                        includes the information, where getfursu.it should look for your commissions status. This
                        happens only once, and you do not need to worry about this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In some cases I will reach out to you, when getfursu.it won't be able to "understand" the
                        information on the page you selected. I'll explain more later.

                        Your website is now tracked, and getfursu.it will periodically check for status changes. No

                    <p>
                        The process of status updates begins with getfursu.it reaching to the database to get
                        all the links to the webpages which it was supposed to track, for all the fursuit makers -
                        including yours!

                    <p>
                        Having the list of links, getfursu.it downloads all the tracked webpages. There are websites
                        getfursu.it supports, and those which it does not - I'll get into details
                        later. There are also some limitations on what the software "understands" (e.g. only the english
                        language). Details later!

                    <p>
                        After getfursu.it fetched all the tracked webpages, it tries to figure out statuses of the
                        commissions. When done, it pushes all the updates into it's database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The software is not perfect, but I supervise the process and fix all the mistakes it makes.
                        In rare cases getfursu.it will no longer be able to track your status. I will reach out to
                        makers, when that happens.

                    <p>
                        When statuses are in the database, all getfursu.it visitors will see your status reflected
                        (copied) from the webpage you selected in the inclusion/update form in the first step. No effort
                        on your side!

            Now that you've read this you should understand how this works and why I decided to give up on learning how
            to draw and instead focused on getfursu.it development.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>You need to actually keep at least <strong>one other</strong> website with up-to-date status</li>
            <li>
                This website needs to contain single and clear information if the commissions are open or not.
                getfursu.it can't track if you are open for parts, but closed for fullsuits, etc. This needs
                to be one, simple "we're open/closed"
            </li>
            <li>
                Not all kinds of websites are supported (yet) - sorry!
                <ul>
                    <li>Generic websites (including Wix.com) - should work</li>
                    <li>FurAffinity <strong>user profile and "pinned" journal entries</strong>
                        - yes, and recommended! <strong>anything else</strong> - nope</li>
                    <li>Twitter - yes, but <strong>only profile info</strong>; tweets - nope</li>
                    <li>Facebook - yes, but <strong>only pinned posts</strong>; overall discouraged</li>
                    <li>Trello - should work</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Approximate delay between update on your website and status getting updated here is between
                6-24 hours, but this is <strong>not guaranteed</strong> everyday
            </li>
            <li>Contact me for "inclusion" and guidance in case of any doubts/problems</li>
        </ul>
