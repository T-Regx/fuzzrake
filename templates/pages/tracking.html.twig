        <h1>Automatic tracking and status updates</h1>

        <p>
            <strong>TL;DR version:</strong> keep a page or profile somewhere with a simple "commissions: open/closed"
            message, submit the address to the page in the inclusion/update form and getfursu.it will check your
            page twice a day to update the status here.
        </p>

        <p>
            Imagine you need to put information about your commissions status (open/closed) in one place only.
            getfursu.it is able to automatically track and reflect your commissions status. How does it work? It's
            easy.
        </p>

                    <h2>1. Fill inclusion/update form</h2>
                    <p>
                        You (the fursuit maker) fill in the <a href="{{ iu_form_url }}">on-line form</a>. In the form
                        you specify on which website/social media account do you keep your commissions status. You need
                        to fill this form only once, and after that you can forget about all of this.

                        I receive all form submissions and put all the information into the getfursu.it database. This
                        includes the information, where getfursu.it should look for your commissions status. This
                        happens only once, and you do not need to worry about this.

                        There may be some cases, when I will reach out to you, because getfursu.it won't be able
                        to "understand" the information on the page you selected. I'll explain more later.

                    <p>
                        The process of status updates begins with getfursu.it reaching to the database to get
                        all the links to the webpages which it was supposed to track, for all the fursuit makers -
                        including yours!

                        Having the list of links, getfursu.it downloads all the tracked webpages. There are websites
                        getfursu.it supports, and those which it does not - I'll get into details
                        later. There are also some limitations on what the software "understands" (e.g. only the english
                        language). Details later!

                    <p>
                        After getfursu.it fetched all the tracked webpages, it tries to figure out statuses of the
                        commissions. When done, it pushes all the updates into it's database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The software is not perfect, but I try to notice and fix any mistakes (e.g. claiming a maker
                        is closed for commissions when it's the opposite). In rare cases getfursu.it will no longer
                        be able to track your status. I may reach out to makers, when that happens.

                    <p>
                        When statuses are in the database, all getfursu.it visitors will see your status reflected
                        (copied) from the webpage you selected in the inclusion/update form in the first step. No effort
                        on your side!

        <p>
            Now that you've read this you should understand how this works and why I decided to give up on learning how
            to draw and instead focused on getfursu.it development.
        </p>

        <h1>Details</h1>

        <p>
            To be successfully tracked, you should put a clear statement if the commissions are open or not on one
            of the websites listed below. This needs to be one, simple "we're open/closed for commissions", or
            "commissions: open/closed" or similar. You can check, what other makers put and where (all makers with
            visible status are tracked, pick one and you'll find out how do they do it).
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment, getfursu.it cannot track if you are, for example, open for parts but not fullsuits/partials.
            Only one, "overall" status is supported.
        </p>

        <h2>Which websites can be tracked</h2>

        <p>
            More websites might become supported in the future. At the moment getfursu.it can handle these:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Most of generic websites (<strong>recommended</strong>)</li>
            <li>Twitter profile info (<strong>recommended</strong>)</li>
            <li>
                FurAffinity user profile info (warning: every time FA turns on DDoS protection mode,
                getfursu.it temporarily looses track!)
            </li>
            <li>Facebook "about" pages usually work</li>
            <li>Trello card text should work</li>
            <li>DeviantArt profile info should work (untested)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unsure? <a href="{{ path('info') }}">Contact me</a> to clarify!</p>

        <h2>Which websites are NOT supported and probably (or for sure) won't work</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Images - if you post your status as an image on your website, then unless the image file is properly
                named, this won't work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Blog entries, posts, journals, tweets, etc. will NOT work. It might work if you pinned them and edited
                the already-pinned in case of updates, instead of posting and pinning a new one. Unfortunately there's
                much which could go wrong. My suggestion is: don't.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unsure? <a href="{{ path('info') }}">Contact me</a> to clarify!</p>

        <h2>Final blah-blahs</h2>

        <p>
            getfursu.it scans websites for changes twice a day, so approximate delay between update on your website
            and status getting updated here should be no more than half a day. Unfortunately, I cannot guarantee that.
