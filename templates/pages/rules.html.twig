    No "open" contact info is allowed (e.g. e-mail address, IM login, etc.). Such info belongs to your website.

    At least one website/social media account is required.
    IM (Messenger, etc.) and e-mail is not a substitute and won't be accepted.
    Also, if a website requires logging in to be viewed, it will not be included. {# are you sure? #}

    "Work in progress" websites are not accepted. Some clients treat website-having makers as preferable, however if
    you do not have a website yet, you'd better make sure you have any portfolio on DA/FA/social first. You can fit any
    information, FAQ, TOS and other stuff there as well. Creating a website is time-consuming and/or expensive.
    It's better to not have one than having one raising doubts/eyebrows.
