    <h1>Rules for makers/studios</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Makers without any fursuit-related portfolio won't be added. At least few completed creations
            must be visible on the maker's website/social media.
            <button class="btn btn-sm btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#rule-pf">More info</button>

            <div class="alert alert-info mt-1 collapse" role="alert" id="rule-pf">
                Consider your own fursuit or starting up with some pre-mades.
                Unfortunately, yet obviously, art portfolio (pictures, badges, etc.) is not fursuit-related.
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            At least one rules-compliant website or social media account is required for your studio to be listed.
        </li>

        <li>
            No "open"/instant messaging contact info is allowed (e.g. e-mail address, Telegram, Messenger, Discord,
            Skype, etc.).
            <button class="btn btn-sm btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#rule-im">More info</button>

            <div class="alert alert-info mt-1 collapse" role="alert" id="rule-im">
                Such info belongs to your website, and may (probably will) be removed from your submission.
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            Websites, which require logging in to view, may be not accepted (this <strong>includes</strong>
            FurAffinity, assuming you configured your user page that way).
        </li>

        <li>
            "Work in progress" websites (e.g websites missing most content, showing example pages, sample texts)
            are not accepted.
            <button class="btn btn-sm btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#rule-wip">More info</button>

            <div class="alert alert-info mt-1 collapse" role="alert" id="rule-wip">
                Some clients treat website-having makers as preferable and/or trustworthy, however if you do not have
                a website yet, you'd better make sure you have some nice portfolio on DA/FA/social first. You can fit
                any information, FAQ, TOS and other stuff there as well. Creating a website is time-consuming
                and/or expensive. It's better to not have a website, than having one raising doubts/eyebrows.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            Makers who are <strong>minors must clearly state that fact</strong> on their website/account.
            This information must be <strong>clearly visible</strong> on the <strong>front page</strong> or equivalent.
            {# See https://github.com/veelkoov/fuzzrake/issues/37 #}
        </li>
        <li>
            All information submitted to getfursu.it must be in (simple) English only (bilingual is not allowed as well).
            <button class="btn btn-sm btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#rule-en">More info</button>

            <div class="alert alert-info mt-1 collapse" role="alert" id="rule-en">
                Your website/social media doesn't have to be in English, however information here must be. If you don't
                speak english, please ask someone for help with translation and make sure to clearly state that you
                don't speak English in the dedicated section of the inclusion/update form.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            This list of rules deliberately skips stuff covered by the common sense.
            <button class="btn btn-sm btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#rule-cs">More info</button>

            <div class="alert alert-info mt-1 collapse" role="alert" id="rule-cs">
                For example, it should be obvious that you must not provide any false or misleading information or
                claim somebody else's work.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            This ruleset is not final. History of changes can be tracked using git.
        </li>
    </ul>
