    <h1>Automatic tracking and status updates</h1>

    <p>
        getfursu.it has limited ability to track and update commissions status (open/closed). On this page:

            <h2>1. Maker fills inclusion/update form</h2>
            <p>
                Fursuit maker decides which of their webpages getfursu.it should monitor for updates. To do that, the maker needs to send the inclusion/update form. This must be done every time the address changes (e.g. the maker decided to abandon one social platform and now posts the updates elsewhere).

        Now that you've read this you should understand how this works and why I decided to give up on learning how to draw and instead focused on getfursu.it development. <small class="text-muted">Disclaimer: images <strong>below</strong> were <strong>not</strong> drawn by me, obviously.

    <h1 id="tracking_limitations">Limitations</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Updates are delayed</strong>: getfursu.it updates statuses twice a day, so it may even take 12 hours for the updates done by a maker to be reflected here. Take this into account if you are waiting for your beloved maker to open. You'd better follow their social media or other stuff. {# grep-tracking-frequency #}
        </li>
        <li>
            Some websites are not supported (see below).
        </li>
        <li>
            Pages requiring to be registered&amp;logged in are not supported.
        </li>
        <li>
            The software will not "click" any links, buttons, etc. Please, provide the exact address of where the status is for tracking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Only simple English language is supported.
        </li>
        <li>
            The software can make mistakes and will use the privilege.

If you need getfursu.it to track your "Accepting Commissions" setting, please state that clearly in the notes! If you only put your status as text in your profile, you are good to go. <strong>NOTE 3</strong>: There were issues with accessing FA in the past, but stuff seems to be working fine now.</small>

        To make getfursu.it track and update your status, make sure your website complies with the above recommendations and <a href="{{ path('data_updates') }}">send the inclusion/update form</a>, providing the website's address in correct field. Of course, don't forget to update your data on getfursu.it, whenever you move commissions information between pages/subpages.
