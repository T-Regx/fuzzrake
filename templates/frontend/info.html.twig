                Welcome to an <strong>incubating project</strong>. The ultimate goal is to make furries rule
                the world, but first things first, we need more fursuits, and this is what this website is
                about. Since this project is <strong>just starting</strong>, there is not much data here,
                nor functionalities. Hopefully this will change over time.

                        Also, I need your advice. I do not sell, I don't really know, what <strong>you</strong>
                        need. Any feedback will be much appreciated. You can have impact on data gathered
                        and functionalities here. Do you have a little time? Just contact me! I'll start
                        with sending you a questionnaire for makers. Don't worry, I bite only when really
                        hungry.

                        know what troubled them while looking for a maker to make this website the best
