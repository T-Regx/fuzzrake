    No "open" contact info is allowed (e.g. e-mail address, IM login, etc.). Such info belongs to your website.

    At least one website/social media account is required. IM (Messenger, Telegram, etc.) and e-mail
    are not substitutes and won't be accepted. Also, if a website requires logging in to be viewed,
    it will not be included. {# are you sure? #}

    "Work in progress" websites are not accepted. Some clients treat website-having makers as preferable, however if
    you do not have a website yet, you'd better make sure you have any portfolio on DA/FA/social first. You can fit any
    information, FAQ, TOS and other stuff there as well. Creating a website is time-consuming and/or expensive.
    It's better to not have one than having one raising doubts/eyebrows.

    Any minor maker must clearly state on their website/account that they are minors. This information should be
    clearly visible on the front page or equivalent.

    Makers without any portfolio (meaning: they haven't posted any photos of their past works) won't be added.
    At least few past creations must be presented. Consider ready-made offers or your own fursuit.
