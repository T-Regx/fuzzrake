                Welcome to an <strong>incubating project</strong>. The ultimate goal is to make furries rule
                the world, but first things first, we need more fursuits, and this is what this website is
                about. Since this project is <strong>just starting</strong>, there is not much data here,
                nor functionalities. Hopefully this will change over time.

                        know what troubled them while looking for a maker to make this website the best

                If you want your studio to be included in this list or some data to be updated (spelling of
                the name, links, types, anything), feel free to <a href="#contact">contact me</a> (Twitter mention
                preferred, thank you)! Or you can put comments directly in this

                and I'll update the site soon (unfortunately, this process is not automated yet). <strong>Note</strong>:
                the spreadsheet might be outdated compared to the site. You don't need to correct stuff which is wrong
                there and correct on the website.

                This website can track and update the status of commissions for your studio - if they're open or closed.
                You don't need to remember to update this information here at all! There are a few need-to-knows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You need to actually keep at least <strong>one other</strong> website with up-to-date status</li>
                <li>
                    Not all kinds of websites are supported (yet) - sorry!
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wix.com hosted websites - nope</li>
                        <li>Generic websites - should work</li>
                        <li>FurAffinity with logging in restriction - nope</li>
                        <li>FurAffinity <strong>user page main info</strong> - yes, and recommended!</li>
                        <li>FurAffinity <strong>anything else, including journals</strong> - nope</li>
                        <li>Twitter - yes, but only profile info</li>
                        <li>Facebook - somehow... but discouraged!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Approximate delay between update on your website and status getting updated here is between
                    6-24 hours, but this is <strong>not guaranteed</strong> everyday
